Whatever you are, be a good one.
Be the change you wish to see in the world.
Try and fail, but never fail to try.
Do one thing every day that scares you.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Let your memory be your travel bag.
To travel is to take a journey into yourself.
I haven't been everywhere, but it's on my list.
If you come to a fork in the road, take it.
April has put a spirit of youth in everything.
Lie down and listen to the crabgrass grow.
The earth laughs in flowers.
Water is the driving force of all nature.
Humanity must go back to nature for information.
Music should strike fire from people's hearts.
Tracy looked at the flag.
The flag is red, white, and blue.
Donald plays the piano.
He loves the piano.
He has a big piano in his living room.
His piano is shiny and black.
The bench has four legs.
This weekend I went to the zoo.
The zoo was in the city.
The drive was very long.
It was hard to stay in one place. 
The wind was too strong.
