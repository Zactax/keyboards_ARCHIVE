# Keyboards Project Archive (keyboards_ARCHIVE)
An archive of my Intro CS class (2020-21) final project. 

The code in this repository is (mostly[^1]) as it was at the end of the school year. 

---

## Goal
The project's goal was to use computer science and progrmming (Python) to determine what characteristics of physical keyboards made them best for typing.



## Details
Local file/folder tree starts at '.../4.Projects/keyboards/'.

The project contains two python programs:
1. Base program - for testing typing speed, among other things, and record results.
2. Results program - for reading and interpreting these results.



## Methodology
For the methodology for this project, please see the file: 'report/Quad_Chart.docx'.



## Closing Remarks
Thank you, Mr. Klein.

Thank you for viewing my project.

### Notes
- All text (.txt) files included in this repository should have one (1) extra blank line at the end of them. In almost all cases, these extra blank lines are essential for the programs to work properly. Both transfering the contents of, and importing these files, removes these, and I'm unable to fix this. 
- As of 05/06/2022 ~6:00pm, the development of this archive is completed.


### Footnotes
