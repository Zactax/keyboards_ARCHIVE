# keyboards_ARCHIVE
An archive of my Intro CS class (2020-21) final project. 

The code in this repository is (mostly[^1]) as it was at the end of the school year.

## Goal
The project's goal was to use computer science and progrmming (Python) to determine what characteristics of physical keyboards made them best for typing.



## Details
File/Folder tree starts at '.../4.Projects/keyboards/'. 

The project contains two python programs:
1. Base program - for testing typing speed, among other things, and record results.
2. Results program - for reading and interpreting these results.
